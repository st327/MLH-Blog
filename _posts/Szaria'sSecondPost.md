This shows you interest in joining their team. It’s also important to research the position you’re applying for. Make sure  you’re aware of the roles and duties, the average salary/wages, and the qualifications for the job. Studying your position can help you prepare questions for the interviewer. Here are questions to ask the interviewer

o	What is the working culture at [insert company name]?

o	What is a typical day working as [insert position]?

o	What are some challenges new hires face as [insert position]?

o	Will this job be remote or onsite?

Tip 2 - Practice your elevator pitch and common interview questions

The first question an interviewer will ask you is “Tell me about yourself”. Although this question seems simple, it is probably the most important question of the interview. Your answer should be a brief summary of your current position, background (professional and educational), and what made choose your career field or the position you’re applying for. This is what you call an elevator pitch. Your elevator pitch should not be longer than 1 minute.  In addition to practicing your elevator pitch, you should also practice common interview questions. The most common questions are

o	What are your strengths and weaknesses?

o	What makes you fit for this position?

o	Why do you want this position?
